\n  Usage: $(basename $0) [ qsub-options ] command arg1 arg2 ...
\n
\n  qrun.sh is a qsub replacement for simple job submissions.  It frees
\n  you from having to write wrapper scripts around the simple command
\n  line that you use interactively: simply put 'qrun.sh' in front of it,
\n  and it will run on the cluster, rather than locally. The qrun.sh
\n  script takes care of all the directories, environment variables
\n  (including the various PATHs and LIBs). Stdout and stderr go to subdir
\n  ./$logdirname, which is created if not present in the current directory. Default
\n  queue is $queue, but you can override this with the -q QUEUENAME
\n  option. A job name, if not specified using -N JOBNAME, is 'invented'
\n  based on the name of submitted command + arguments.
\n
\n  For simplicity, there is only a limited number of qsub options
\n  available, all of them single-letter options (SGE's qsub are not
\n  always!).  The most important ones are: -q (specifies queue) and -N
\n  (specifies jobname). Other qsub options currently recognized are -j
\n  (join stdout and stderr), -M (mail address to use) -m (when to mail),
\n  -p (priority) and -l (resources). For the -p option (corresponds
\n  to qsub's \"-pe\") you can specify the environment and the number
\n  separated by '='. I.e. both -p 'threaded 4' and -p threaded=4 are
\n  fine (the latter may save you quoting trouble). Option -h
\n  correpsonds to qsub's option \"-hold_jid\"; option -H to qsub's
\n  \"-hold_jid_ad\"
\n
\n  Unix pipe lines can be specified as a job, but the pipeline must be
\n  quoted as a whole, which would look like
\n
\n  $ qrun.sh \"cmd1 | cmd2 > out.txt\"
\n
\n  Be careful in this case with the dollar signs of variable references
\n  (including things like \$1, \$2 in a one-liner awk or
\n  perl-script). Escape them to avoid premature substitution by the
\n  invoking shell.
\n
\n  If your system has no ldapsearch for looking up the e-mail address, 
\n  consider creating a file $HOME/.forward that contains the right
\n  e-mail address (file must be unreadable to group and world).
\n
\n  Due to some brain damage on the part of both CentOS and SGE, you may
\n  see errors like 'sh: which: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of
\n  file'. These errors are harmless.
